# Grappachu.Core
My personal collection of utilities

# Goal
The purpose of this package is to create my own package, multi-framework and free from 3rd party dependencies. 

# Getting Started
You can simply download and feel free to explore the classes in the package. Namespaces used are very close to Microsoft choiches so it should make everything easier to use.

**Be aware from Grappachu.Core.Preview namespace! This is only for unreleased classes and averything inside of it can change in signatures (and of course namespace) without advice.**
